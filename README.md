# Physics_free
a little physics game I made in Love2d, using Love 2d's default physics engine. It's an interesting little project, serves as an OK-enough example for how to queue up the physics engine. You can spawn in physics rectangles, remove them, and control a physics-based rectangle that happens to be red. I updated the controls and config file to make it work with Love 11, but other than that it's the same as what I wrote back in the day.
